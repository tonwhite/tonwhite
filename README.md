-  Salute, Ton White here. I am a Junior FrontEnd developer.
-  This readme won't have any emojis, because <blockqoute>The world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows.</blockqoute>
-  I’m currently learning HTML/CSS, but mostly JavaScript
-  If you want to propose me a job, it's a right thing to do.
-  You can contact me here on GitHub.
